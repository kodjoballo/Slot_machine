### 🚀 Suggested Improvements

Better UI 🎨

Use ASCII art for the slot machine frame.

Highlight wins (maybe *A* | B | C).

Replay Options
After quitting, ask the player if they want to deposit more money instead of just ending.

###  Statistics 📊

Track total spins, wins, and net profit/loss.

Future upgrade idea:

Convert to Tkinter / Pygame GUI with real spinning reels 🎡.
